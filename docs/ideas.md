**Innovative Idea**:
Our project idea focuses on creating a list of movies based on two user profiles on one streaming service. The user will input a list of genres they enjoy, past movies they have already watched, and a friend from their friend list they want to watch with. The application will find a list of movies that fit the genre and are not in any of the friends’ watch history to return suggestions of movies that the user chooses from. Once a show or movie has been watched, users can put this into their “history.” They can also favorite shows and movies that they would like to watch within the blend. We will use the movie database api for our data on the movies. This app would be helpful in planning friend movie nights if they don’t know what to watch. 

**Important Components**:
We plan to use The Movie Database API for our data on the movies https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction . This API allows you to filter by genre which is what we primarily would use to create the list of possible movies to watch. To simplify the scope of the web app, we were thinking of limiting it to only movies and the movies we work with to one streaming service which we can also do through the API. Each user will also have a friend list and users can select a friend from their list to generate the list of movies they could watch together. So the data we are using would be data on the movies, user friend lists, user’s watch history, and user’s top genres which can be displayed on their profile. This app would be useful for planning friend movie nights if they don’t know what to watch. The user just needs to input who is watching together (choose from friend list) and what genre of movie they’d like to watch. Then the web app looks at movies that fit the genre and also are not in any of the friends’ watch history to return suggestions of movies to watch that they user chooses from.
